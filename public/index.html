			<p>SYNOPSES</p>

			<p>
				#1. More Than Ever. (July 2011)<br>
				‘More Than Ever' is a doc portrait of New Yorkers John Hilton and Bill Campbell, a couple who beat the odds through the decades in order to live an incredible 54-year love story. We revisit their time in the military, their trips abroad, and their latest challenge: coping with Parkinson’s. Their story of devotion is an inspiration to LGBT people as well as to anyone wondering how to make love last.
			</p>

			<p>
				#2. Say Only Yes. (January 2012)<br>
				‘The Devotion Project: Say Only Yes’ features Brian Cantor and Paul Labrecque, chronicling their meeting in London in 1986, the opening of the hugely successful Paul Labrecque Salons in NYC, and the serious obstacles they overcame on their way to getting married on the day of their 25th anniversary, the very first weekend gay marriage was legal in New York.
			</p>

			<p>
				#3. Listen from the Heart. (April 2012) <br>
				‘The Devotion Project: Listen from the Heart’, the third film in a series, traces the relationship of Laura Fitch and Jaime Jenett, from their initial meeting and love affair, through the birth of their child, a boy with a heart condition who enriches their lives in ways they could never have imagined.
			</p>

			<p>
				 #4. My Person. (May 2012) <br>
				‘The Devotion Project: My Person' chronicles the lives of Eric and Anne Plemons, who are raising their daughter Jonah in Oakland, CA. Eric, a trans man, met Anne, a queer woman, in Chicago seven years ago - together they describe their romance, marriage, and the birth of their daughter. They also discuss the challenges they face as a trans couple and how they've overcome adversity to become a very traditional non-traditional family.
			</p>

			<p>
				#5. Build Your Wings. (August 2012)<br>
				Daniel Pando and Vitor Braga Lara are a young gay couple who met in Ft. Lauderdale as teenagers and have been together eight years. Instantly relatable to young people, they talk us through the adventure of meeting, moving up to NYC, and their very modern take on long-lasting love, including a very special birthday surprise.
			</p>

			<p>
				#6. Foremost in my Mind. (February 2013)<br>
				Gail Marquis, an Olympic Medalist (Montreal ‘76), met Audrey Smaltz when she was 43 and Smaltz, a former model, was 61. They'd each had other relationships, Marquis with women and Smaltz with men, but until they met it had never 'clicked'. Smaltz, an entrepreneur who works in fashion, didn't miss a beat when telling friends about her new love, and they soon became inseparable. This story will resonate with the “late bloomers” among us as it tracks the course of these women's incredible lives, each rich with accomplishment, and celebrates their love story.
